## Notes on Jake VanderPlas's book "Python Data Science Handbook".

This is a summary of my notes from Jake VanderPlas's book "Python Data Science Handbook". If you prefer to learn casually and look up different data science techniques rather than actually going through the entire book, then this is for you.

The book covers the basics of data manipulation, data visualization, and some machine learning techniques using tools like NumPy and Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, etc. to effectively store, manipulate, and analyze your data.

Excluding the introductory chapter 1, the notes will be based on chapter 2 through 5.

Visit Jake VanderPlas's Github at https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook for more information.
#### The data that he uses can be accessed here : https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/data/
##### Some data may be missing and may need to be downloaded from other sources. This was one of the reasons I skipped many examples on my notes.
