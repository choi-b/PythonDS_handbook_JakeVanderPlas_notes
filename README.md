## Notes on Jake VanderPlas's book "Python Data Science Handbook".

I made a summary of Jake VanderPlas's book "Python Data Science Handbook". This repository might be beneficial for some who prefer to learn casually (like me) rather than actually going through the entire book.

The book covers the basics of data manipulation, data visualization, and some machine learning techniques using tools like NumPy and Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, etc. to effectively store, manipulate, and analyze your data.

Excluding the introductory chapter 1, the notes will be based on chapter 2 through 5.

Visit Jake VanderPlas's Github at https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook for more information.
#### The data that he uses can be accessed here : https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/data/
##### Some data may be missing and may need downloads from other sources. This was one of the reasons, I skipped many examples on my notes.
